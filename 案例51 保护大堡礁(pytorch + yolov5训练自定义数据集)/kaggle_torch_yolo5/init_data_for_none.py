# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker images: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
from shutil import copyfile

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory
